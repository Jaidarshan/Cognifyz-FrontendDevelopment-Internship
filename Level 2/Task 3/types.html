            <h1>Supercomputer</h1>
            <p>When we talk about speed, then the first name that comes to mind when thinking of computers is
                supercomputers. They are the biggest and fastest computers (in terms of speed of processing data).
                Supercomputers are designed such that they can process a huge amount of data, like processing trillions
                of instructions or data just in a second. This is because of the thousands of interconnected processors
                in supercomputers. It is basically used in scientific and engineering applications such as weather
                forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research. It was first developed by Roger Cray
                in 1976.</p>

            <h1>Mainframe computer</h1>
            <p>Mainframe computers are designed in such a way that they can support hundreds or thousands of users at
                the same time. It also supports multiple programs simultaneously. So, they can execute different
                processes simultaneously. All these features make the mainframe computer ideal for big organizations
                like banking, telecom sectors, etc., which process a high volume of data in general.</p>

            <h1>Minicomputer</h1>
            <p>Minicomputer is a medium size multiprocessing computer. In this type of computer, there are two or more
                processors, and it supports 4 to 200 users at one time. Minicomputer is similar to Microcontroller.
                Minicomputers are used in places like institutes or departments for different work like billing,
                accounting, inventory management, etc. It is smaller than a mainframe computer but larger in comparison
                to the microcomputer.</p>

            <p>A workstation computer is designed for technical or scientific applications. It consists of a fast
                microprocessor, with a large amount of RAM and a high-speed graphic adapter. It is a single-user
                computer. It is generally used to perform a specific task with great accuracy.</p>

            <h1>Personal Computer (PC)</h1>
            <p>Personal Computers is also known as a microcomputer. It is basically a general-purpose computer designed
                for individual use. It consists of a microprocessor as a central processing unit(CPU), memory, input
                unit, and output unit. This kind of computer is suitable for personal work such as making an assignment,
                watching a movie, or at the office for office work, etc. For example, Laptops and desktop computers.</p>

            <h1>Analog Computer</h1>
            <p>Analog Computers are particularly designed to process analog data. Continuous data that changes
                continuously and cannot have discrete values are called analog data. So, an analog computer is used
                where we donâ€™t need exact values or need approximate values such as speed, temperature, pressure, etc.
                It can directly accept the data from the measuring device without first converting it into numbers and
                codes. It measures the continuous changes in physical quantity. It gives output as a reading on a dial
                or scale. For example speedometer, mercury thermometer, etc.</p>

            <h1>Digital Computer</h1>
            <p>Digital computers are designed in such a way that they can easily perform calculations and logical
                operations at high speed. It takes raw data as input and processes it with programs stored in its memory
                to produce the final output. It only understands the binary input 0 and 1, so the raw input data is
                converted to 0 and 1 by the computer and then it is processed by the computer to produce the result or
                final output. All modern computers, like laptops, desktops including smartphones are digital computers.

            <h1>Hybrid Computer</h1>
            <p>As the name suggests hybrid, which means made by combining two different things. Similarly, the hybrid
                computer is a combination of both analog and digital computers. Hybrid computers are fast like analog
                computers and have memory and accuracy like digital computers. So, it has the ability to process both
                continuous and discrete data. For working when it accepts analog signals as input then it converts them
                into digital form before processing the input data. So, it is widely used in specialized applications
                where both analog and digital data are required to be processed. A processor which is used in petrol
                pumps that converts the measurements of fuel flow into quantity and price is an example of a hybrid
                computer. </p>

            <h1>Quantum Computer</h1>
            <p>It is a computer that uses quantum mechanics to store and process data. Unlike classical computers, which
                use bits to represent data (each bit can be either 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits),
                which can be in superposition, meaning they can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows them to
                perform calculations much faster than classical computers. </p>
