                our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.From the
                surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from
                Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
                Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to
                its dense atmosphere.
                Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
                briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse
                at sunset.

            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Inter, sans-serif; color: rgb(85, 107, 47);">Venus is the second
                planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial
                (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These
                are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
                Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick,
                yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest
                planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are
                about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty
                color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists
                think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.
                Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the
                pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.</p>

                Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited
                by living things.
                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
                system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of
                the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
                The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek
                and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the
                ground.”

                planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic
                planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more
                active in the past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only
                planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
                NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
                (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.
                Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on
                Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers).

                history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons
                beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter
                is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets
                combined.
                Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in
                an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth
                that has raged for hundreds of years.
                One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is currently exploring this giant world.</p>

                planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as
                Saturn's.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It
                was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
                William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later
                that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer
                Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George
                III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of
                the sky, as suggested by Bode.S</p>

                Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in
                our solar system.
                More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not
                visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune
                completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
                NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its
                way out of the solar system.</p>
